# Spikes

## What is a Spike?

There is a problem we want to solve; but, do not have enough information to determine and story point an actual approach.

A Spike involves some of the following:

* Research
* Discovery
* Design
* Prototyping
* Experimentation

### Goals:

* Establish enough knowledge to determine a technical approach
    * Should be able to create appropriate Jira tickets with story points _or_
    * Establish next steps to flush out the problem/requirements more
* Evaluate a code library or framework to use
* Evaluae a third party service
* Etc

## Timebox

* A spike should be given 3 story points by default.
* A spike should never be more than 2-3 days of effort.

## How to complete a Spike

When the research is complete, the following should happen:

* Schedule a meeting with team members and PM (30 minutes)
    * Share findings or demo prototype
* Create jira tickets _or_
* Determine next steps
